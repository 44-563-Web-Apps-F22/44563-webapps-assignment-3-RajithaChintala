    <h2>Rescued By RUBY is one of my Favourite Movie</h2>
    <p>This Movies is Based on a True Story. This story revolves around the person who is Chasing his dream to join an elite K-9 unit, a state trooper partners with a fellow underdog: clever but naughty shelter pup Ruby.</p>
    <p>I personally liked this movie because the lead actor doesn't give up on his dreams at any cost though the naughty dog is making his life rough.</p>
